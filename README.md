# Objectives

The main objetive of this repository is to contain programmatic tools for solving or
for helping in the manual resolution of classical ciphers cryptograms.

## Ciphers

What follows is a list of classical ciphers, mostly extracted from 
_Cryptanalysis, a study of ciphers and their solution_ by Helen Fouche Gaines.
It's an informal TODO checklist of desired functionality be implemented in certain
way, and might be mixed with general tips in cases when an implementation doesn't
make sense.

### Concealment ciphers

- [ ] Word Alignment 
- [ ] Bacons Bilateral Cipher
- [ ] Tri-numeral alphabets
    - [ ] # of syllabes per word
    - [ ] # vowels/uppercase/other per word

### Transposition ciphers

* Regular/Irregular

#### Columnar Transposition

- [ ] Magic Square
- [ ] Knights Tour
- [ ] Route transposition
    - [ ] Vertical
    - [ ] Horizontal
    - [ ] Diagonal
- [ ] Rail Fence 
- [ ] Double transposition
